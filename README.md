# Ableton website home page recreation (Frontend Practice)

A responsive front-end recreation of the [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) website's home page. This is a self-directed challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton) to improve my layout, design, and vanilla JavaScript skills. Also, because it's fun.
