# Ableton Website Recreation (Frontend Practice)

a responsive front-end recreation of the [Ableton](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton) website. this is a self-directed challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton) to improve my layout, design, and vanilla javascript skills. also, because it's fun.

## 📌 about the project

the goal is to recerate the structure, appearance, and behavior of the **Ableton website**. not just the homepage, but multiple public-facing pages, or just the ones i like.
this is a **pure front-end project**: no frameworks, libraries, or build tools. just pure **html**, **css**, and **javascript**. 🙃

> ❗this is a personal practice project! all banding, content, and design elements remain the property of Ableton. this clone is for educational, recreational, and non-commercial use only.
> images, and text may be replaced with placeholders or free-to-use alternatives.
